# Rust Amongify

You can blame [@JasonX5](https://github.com/Volterium) for this existing

Takes an input string and randomly replaces some of its characters with ඞ

## ULTRA ඞ SUS ඞ MODE™️

Before using this program, it would be good to know what the ULTRA ඞ SUS ඞ MODE™️ is. So basically, replaces all occurences of `sus` with `ඞ` and, if the total number of `ඞ` characters is 69 or 420 after the string processing is done, display a message.

**Note: When using ULTRA ඞ SUS ඞ MODE™️, there is a very small chance that mass hysteria surrounding the video-game-that-shall-not-be-named will happen, the universe will undergo a false-vacuum decay or an ധK-Class scenario will occur**

## Installation

1) Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed
2) Clone this repo using Git
3) `cd` to the cloned dir and run `cargo build --release` to build the executable at `./target/release/`

## Usage

```
amongify --help

A very ඞ sus ඞ program

Sussifies an input string
For each character on the input string, there is a n/m chance of itbeing replaced with ඞ, where n = 1 unless set by the user using--sus option and m = 10 unless set using the --max-sus option

ULTRA ඞ SUS ඞ MODE™️
Please be very careful when you are using the ULTRA ඞ SUS ඞ MODE™️. Incorrect usage of it can result in mass hysteria, false vacuum decay or/and an ധK-Class scenario

Replaces all occurences of the word "sus" (lowercase and uppercase) with ඞ. Furthermore, it displays a funni message if the total number of ඞ occurences after the processing of the input string is over sum up to either 69 or 420

Usage: amongify [OPTIONS] <string>

Arguments:
  <string>
          Input string to ඞ sussify ඞ

Options:
  -s, --sus <sussiness>
          How ඞ sus ඞ you want the output string to be
          
          [default: 1]

      --max-sus <max-sussiness>
          Set a new upper limit for how ඞ sus ඞ the output string can be
          
          [default: 10]

  -U, --ultra-sus
          Activate the ULTRA ඞ SUS ඞ MODE™️. I sure hope you know what you are doing

  -y
          Skip all safety checks when running ULTRA ඞ SUS ඞ MODE™️
          
          WARNING: This will make the program ultra ඞ sus ඞ. By running this you accept the possibility that a specialised Interpol unit may be deployed near your location because you are being ultra ඞ sus ඞ
